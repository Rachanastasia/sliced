# [Sliced](https://sliced.vercel.app/)

This is the repository for [Sliced](https://sliced.vercel.app/), the app to scale your recipes.

With Sliced, users can scale up and down their favorite recipes. Sliced parses the ingredient text and allows the user to change the amount. The TypeScript algorithm used to parse and manipulate recipe data resides in [its own repo](https://github.com/rachelrly/slicer).

For example, Sally wants to make cookies. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup butter, but she only has 1/3 cup. Sally can copy and paste her recipe in Sliced, and the app will convert the text into a list of ingredients that can be scaled. To scale the recipe down, she can click on "1/2" on the butter ingredient and enter "1/3". This will scale the entire recipe to the new:original ratio. Before scaling, Sally knows she doesn't want to scale down the amount of chocolate chips, so she presses the lock icon on the right to `unlock` and preserve the current amount. After scaling, she wants to increase the amount of vanilla extract, so she unlocks the ingredient and changes the amount without effecting the ratio of rest of the recipe.

## Codebase (`/client`)

The Sliced codebase resides in a client folder because the original version had a backend that allowed user creation and recipe persistence. The backend was dropped to give more attention to the [Slicer algorithm](https://github.com/rachelrly/slicer). View the original [client](https://github.com/rachelrly/sliced-client) and [server](https://github.com/rachelrly/sliced-api), created in 2020 for Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion program.
