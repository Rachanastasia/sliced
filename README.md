# [Sliced](https://sliced.vercel.app/)

This is the repository for [Sliced](https://sliced.vercel.app/), the app to scale your recipes.

With Sliced, users can scale up and down their favorite recipes. Sliced parses the ingredient text and allows the user to change the amount. The TypeScript algorithm used to parse and manipulate recipe data resides in [its own repo](https://github.com/rachelrly/slicer).

For example, if Sally wants to make cookies. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup butter, but she only has 1/3 cup. Sally can copy and paste her recipe in Sliced, and the app will convert the text into a list of ingredients that can be scaled. To scale the recipe down, she can click on the amount of the butter ingredient list and enter the desired amount. This will scale the entire recipe to the new:original ratio.

## Codebase (`/client`)

The Sliced codebase resides in a client folder because the original version had a backend that allowed user creation and recipe persistence. The backend was dropped to give more attention to the [Slicer algorithm](https://github.com/rachelrly/slicer). View the original [client](https://github.com/rachelrly/sliced-client) and [server](https://github.com/rachelrly/sliced-api), created in 2020 for Thinkful's Software Engineering Immersion program.
