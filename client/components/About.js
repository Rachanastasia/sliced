      <p className={styles.about_p}>
        I first conceptualized Sliced at the beginning of the pandemic when I
        was cooking for 2 and making do with what I had in the kitchen. I kept
        asking Siri <em>whats half of 1/3 cups in tablespoons</em> and manually
        scaling my recipe to the lowest common denominator of the ingredients I
        had on-hand. Even with food more readily accessable, the need for sliced
        continues.

      <p className={styles.about_p}>
        Traditionally, home recipes are scaled to feed the neucular family. That
        leaves those of us without 2.5 kids and a husband with a lot of
        leftovers.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.about_p}>
        With Sliced, home cooks can scale their recipes up or down to accomidate
        amount of people they are feeding or the amount of ingredients they
        have. Sliced hopes to bring XXX in a world where even recipes are
        pushing you to subscribe to societal norms.

        The modern woman isn't cooking for the neucular family, she's cooking an
        app to eliminate food waste and fighting against societal norms.✌️

// Traditional recipes are scaled for the neucular family
// As people continue to differ in how they live,
// Can cope with food waste
// Which means that people

// Recipes are scaled for the neucular family, which leaves those of us without children with excess leftovers

// Rather

// I don't always cook with a recipe, but when I do, I use Sliced

// How limiting it is to have recipes scaled for the neucular family.

// Sliced allows users to copy and paste recipes from elsewhere and adapt those ingredients as well as scale them.
// Users can exclude ingredients from the scale by unlocking them or

// recipes are scaled to feed the neucular family, not the rest of us
// mealkits basicaly just shop and plan for you

// The default measurement for recipes is scaled to the neucular familiy, leaving those of us without a husband and 2.5 kids with lots of leftovers.
//
// which puts people without children or couple-friends in a predicament
// For those of us without a husband and 2.5 kids,
//

// As we enbody difference in our lives, our culinary needs change.

/**
 * Sliced originated from the desire to take recipes scaled by default to the neucular family and adapting their measurements to
